Description- I have created a dashboard utilizing HR data through the Looker Studio Tool. The project involved several steps to analyze and visualize the data effectively:

1. **Payment Information Analysis:**
   I began by extracting payment information using a scorecard approach. This involved calculating metrics such as average payment, minimum payment, and maximum payment. These insights provided a comprehensive view of the payment distribution within the dataset.

2. **Manager PayRate Comparison:**
   Using bar charts, I compared the PayRate per hour among different managers. This visualization allowed for an easy comparison of how each manager's team's pay rates differ, highlighting potential disparities or trends.

3. **Top 10 Employees by PayRate:**
   Employing a table chart, I showcased the top 10 employees with the highest PayRate per hour. This table provided a clear list of the highest earners within the organization, aiding in recognizing exceptional performance.

4. **Geographic Distribution:**
   Through a Geo chart, I visualized the distribution of employees across various cities. This geographic insight helps in understanding the concentration of employees in different regions.

5. **City-wise Percentage Breakdown:**
   A Pie chart was employed to represent the percentage distribution of employees across different cities. This visualization method succinctly illustrated the proportion of the workforce in each location.

6. **Employee Insights Overview:**
   I further utilized various other chart types to derive Employee Insights Overview. This likely includes aspects such as performance trends, tenure distribution, and potentially further segmentation of employees based on specific criteria. These visualizations aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the workforce.

In summary, the project utilized Looker Studio Tool to create a comprehensive HR dashboard. It began with analyzing payment information through scorecards, followed by comparative analysis of PayRate among managers, showcasing top earners, mapping employee distribution, and providing insights into workforce demographics. The culmination of these visualizations aims to provide a comprehensive and actionable overview of the HR data for informed decision-making and strategic planning.
